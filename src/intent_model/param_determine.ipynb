    "# Overview of Design\n",
    "Goal: Message + Intent --> Params\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where a model learns to find and label certain parts of a sentence that represent 'entities', like names, dates, songs, places, artists, etc.\n",
    "In this case, NER will be used to identify where the entities are and what type they are in the provided user message\n",
    "This will work in conjunction with the intent determining model, which tells you what the user wants. This model will specify what they are talking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Avenues\n",
    "1. HuggingFace Transformers: May consider for future, but seems overkill for now with GPU training\n",
    "2. OpenAI/GPT: Needs Wi-Fi connection, unideal\n",
    "3. spaCy: Ideal for smaller datasets, this was the chosen model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NER with spaCy Steps\n",
    "1. Tokenize the input (split into words)\n",
    "2. Embedding Layer Converts each token (word) into vector representation\n",
    "3. Feeds into a neural network (Convolutional / transition-based feature extractor --> Feedforward layers for tagging each token --> trained via backpropagation)\n",
    "4. Network outputs a label for each token"
