# SmartRise: The AI-Powered Multimedia Alarm System

SmartRise is a voice-controlled, AI-enhanced alarm clock system built on a Raspberry Pi 4. It is designed to help users start and end their days intentionally without needing a phone. Through integrated voice commands, music playback, alarm scheduling, and local AI interaction, SmartRise creates a screen-free, productivity-focused experience.

## üéØ Purpose & Motivation

Modern routines often start and end with distraction-heavy phone use. SmartRise was created as a healthier, distraction-free alternative: a bedside assistant that combines the best features of music, alarms, and AI chat into a single local-first system. Beyond solving a personal pain point, it also serves as a portfolio piece for roles in embedded systems, AI automation, and post-silicon validation.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

STT (Speech-to-Text): Uses Whisper on a remote AWS EC2 server instance to transcribe audio commands.

TTS (Text-to-Speech): Uses pyttsx3 for fully offline responses.

Intent Classification: Custom-trained TF-IDF + SVM model to classify commands like "play music", "set alarm", etc.

Parameter Extraction: spaCy NER model trained to extract artist, song, time, label, etc.

Alarm System: SQLite-backed alarm manager that schedules, triggers, and logs custom alarms with Dateparser.

Music Playback: Plays .mp3 files stored locally using Pygame Mixer.

Chatbot: Local/offline LLM integration using Ollama for casual Q&A or fallback support.


### Main Command Loop (Overview)

Continuously checks the alarm database for triggered events.

Waits for wake-word ("smartrise" or "jarvis") via short speech segment.

On detection, prompts user and records main command.

Classifies the intent and extracts relevant parameters.

Executes the associated function: play music, set alarm, stop alarm, etc.

Responds with TTS or executes fallback AI chat if no match found.
